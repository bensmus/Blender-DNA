# Blender-DNA

By running dna.py inside a blender file (blender 2.83), you create a group of objects representing the Nitrogenous bases (modelled as cylinders) and the Sugar-Phosphate backbone (modelled as bevelled NUMBS curves).
The bases are chosen randomly, so each time you run the script, you get a different DNA molecule!
